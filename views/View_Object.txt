View Object
===========

An object that is passed to every callback, containing info about the current view.

It will be populated with the following properties:

`name`
:	Name of one of the [Available Views]() (a string).

`title`
:	Title text that is displayed at the top of the header (such as “September 2009” or “Sep 7 - 13 2009”).

`start`
:	A Date object of the first day of the month/week. If day-view, the date of the single day.
   
`end`
:	A Date object of the day after the last day of the month/week. If day-view, the Date after the single day.

	Because this is an exclusive value, if the calendar has a month-view on October 2009, `end` will be November 1st.
	
`visStart`
:	A Date object of the first visible day of the view. In month-view, this value is often before the 1st day of the month,
	because most months do not begin on a Monday.

	In week and day views, this value will always be the same as `start`.

`visEnd`
:	A Date object of the day after the last visible day (because it is exclusive like `end`).
