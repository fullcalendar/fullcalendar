weekNumbers
===========

Determines if week numbers should be displayed on the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `false`
</div>

If set to `true`, week numbers will be displayed in a separate left column in the month/basic views
as well as at the top-left corner of the agenda views. See [Available Views](../views/Available_Views).

By default, FullCalendar will use the current locale's week number calculation method.
To display other types of week numbers, see [weekNumberCalculation](weekNumberCalculation).
