aspectRatio
===========

Determines the width-to-height aspect ratio of the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Float, *default*: `1.35`
</div>

A calendar is a block-level element that fills its entire avaiable width.
The calendar’s height, however, is determined by this ratio of width-to-height.
(Hint: larger numbers make smaller heights).

The following example will initialize a calendar who's width is twice its height:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		aspectRatio: 2
	});

More precisely, this is the aspect ratio of the calendar's "content" area
(the area with a className of "fc-view-container").
	
	
Setter
------

You can dynamically set a calendar's aspectRatio after initialization:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar('option', 'aspectRatio', 1.8);
