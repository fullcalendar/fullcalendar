windowResize *1.3*
==================

Triggered after the calendar's dimensions have been changed due to the browser window being resized.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *view* ) { }
</div>

The calendar has automatically adapted to the new size when windowResize is triggered.

`view` is a [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Within the callback function, `this` will be set to the calendar's main element.

Example:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		windowResize: function(view) {
			alert('The calendar has adjusted to a window resize');
		}
	});

<div class='version-info' markdown='1'>
In version 1.1 through 1.2.1, this option was known as *resize*.
</div>
