businessHours *2.2*
===================

Emphasizes certain time slots on the calendar. By default, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
boolean / object. *default*: `false`
</div>

If `true`, the default business hours will be emphasized.
This only applies to the time slots in the agenda [views].
If `false` (the default), there will be no emphasis.

An object may be given to render business hours with fine-grain control over the days/hours.
The object may have any of the following properties:

	businessHours: {
		// days of week. an array of zero-based day of week integers (0=Sunday)
		dow: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] // Monday - Thursday

		start: '10:00', // a start time (10am in this example)
		end: '18:00', // an end time (6pm in this example)
	}

You may also break your business hour declaration into parts for additional control
(added in v2.9.1):

	businessHours: [ // specify an array instead
		{
			dow: [ 1, 2, 3 ], // Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
			start: '08:00' // 8am
			end: '18:00' // 6pm
		},
		{
			dow: [ 4, 5 ], // Thursday, Friday
			start: '10:00', // 10am
			end: '16:00' // 4pm
		}
	]

If you are using one of the resource views from the [Scheduler plugin](../scheduler/),
you may specify business hours on a per-resource basis. See the [Resource Object](../resource_data/Resource_Object/)
docs for more information.

More information on specifying times can be found in the [Duration] article.
