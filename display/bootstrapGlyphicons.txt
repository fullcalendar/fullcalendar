bootstrapGlyphicons *3.5.0*
===========================

Determines which icons are displayed in buttons of the header when Bootstrap theming is on.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Object, *default:*

	{
		close: 'glyphicon-remove',
		prev: 'glyphicon-chevron-left',
		next: 'glyphicon-chevron-right',
		prevYear: 'glyphicon-backward',
		nextYear: 'glyphicon-forward'
	}
</div>

This option only applies to calendars that have [themeSystem]() set to `'bootstrap3'`.

A hash must be supplied that maps button names (from the [header]()) to icon strings.
[See a full list of Bootstrap glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#glyphicons).

If a button does not have an entry, it falls back to using [buttonText](../text/buttonText).

If you are using a Bootstrap theme and would prefer not to display any icons and would rather
use `buttonText` instead, you can set the `bootstrapGlyphicons` option to `false`.
