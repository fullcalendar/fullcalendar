Event Colors
============

You can modify the default color that affects all events by adding some css in the following form:

	.fc-event,
	.fc-agenda .fc-event-time,
	.fc-event a {
		background-color: black; /* background color */
		border-color: black;     /* border color */
		color: red;              /* text color */
		}

You can also change the color for certain events by using the `className` property of each [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object).
Here is an example of the CSS you would write if your `className` was "holiday":

	.holiday,
	.fc-agenda .holiday .fc-event-time,
	.holiday a {
		background-color: green; /* background color */
		border-color: green;     /* border color */
		color: yellow;           /* text color */
		}

If you are using the "default" and "className" techniques together,
make sure the CSS for the "default" technique comes first.
