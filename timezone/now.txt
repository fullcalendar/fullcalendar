now
===

Explicitly sets the "today" date of the calendar.
This is the day that is normally highlighted in yellow.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Moment, function
</div>

Normally, the local browser's current date is used.

You can override the current date by providing a Moment-like value, such
as an ISO8601 date string like `"2013-12-01T00:00:00"`.

You can also provide a function that returns a Moment-like value.

Overriding the current date is particularly useful when your calendar is
using a custom [timezone]() parameter. The current year/month/date in the custom
timezone might be different than the local computer's current date.

You'll most likely want to calculate this with a server-side script and inject
it into the settings of the calendar. Here is an example in PHP:

	<?php
		$datetime = new DateTime('now', 'America/Chicago');
		$datetime_string = $datetime->format('c');
	?>

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		now: <?php echo json_encode($datetime_string) ?>
	});
