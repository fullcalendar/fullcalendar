lang
====

Customize the language and localization options for the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
A String language code. *default*: `"en"`
</div>

This option affects many things such as:

- the text in buttons, as defined by [header](../display/header)
- text that contains month or day-of-week strings
- date formatting strings, such as [timeFormat]()
- [weekNumberCalculation](../display/weekNumberCalculation)
- [firstDay](../display/firstDay)


How to use other languages
--------------------------

You will need to load the language's JavaScript data file in order to use it.
These files are included with the FullCalendar download in the `lang/` directory.
They must be loaded via a `<script>` tag after the main FullCalendar library is loaded.

	<script src='fullcalendar/fullcalendar.js'></script>
	<script src='fullcalendar/lang/es.js'></script>
	<script>

		$(document).ready(function() {

			$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
			});

		});

	</script>

If you are simply loading one language, you do *not* need to specify the `lang` option.
FullCalendar will look at the most recent language file loaded and use it.

However, if more than one language file is loaded, or the combined `all.js` file is loaded,
you must explicitly specify which language to use via the `lang` option:

	<script src='fullcalendar/fullcalendar.js'></script>
	<script src='fullcalendar/lang-all.js'></script>
	<script>

		$(document).ready(function() {

			$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
				lang: 'es'
			});

		});

	</script>

For more information, see the [live example](../../../../js/fullcalendar-2.0.0/demos/languages.html).


MomentJS and jQuery UI Datepicker
---------------------------------

When you load a FullCalendar language file, it also loads the translations
for MomentJS and jQuery UI Datepicker (if the library is already on the page).
Just make sure to include the `<script>` tags for Moment and Datepicker before
you include FullCalendar's language file:

	<script src='lib/moment.js'></script>
	<script src='lib/jquery-ui.custom-datepicker.js'></script>
	<script src='fullcalendar/fullcalendar.js'></script>
	<script src='fullcalendar/lang-all.js'></script>
