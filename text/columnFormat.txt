columnFormat
============

Determines the text that will be displayed on the calendar's column headings.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
[format string](../utilities/date_formatting_string), *default*:

	'ddd'     // like 'Mon', for month view
	'ddd M/D' // like 'Mon 9/7', for week views
	'dddd'    // like 'Monday', for day views
</div>

As noted above, each view has a specific default. Get fine-tuned control with [View-Specific Options](../views/View-Specific-Options).
A single string alone will set the value for all views.

The default values will change based on the current [locale](../text/locale).
