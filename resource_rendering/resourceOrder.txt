resourceOrder
=============

Determines the ordering of the resource list.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
String
</div>

Can be a single [Resource Object](../resource_data/Resource_Object)
property name. The resources will be ordered ascendingly by the value of this property.

If prefixed with a minus sign like `'-propertyName'`, the ordering will be descending.

Compound ordering criteria can be specified as a single string separated by commas.

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		resourceOrder: '-type1,type2',
		resources: [
			{
				id: 'A',
				title: 'Resource A',
				type1: 10,
				type2: 55
			},
			{
				id: 'B',
				title: 'Resource B',
				type1: 12,
				type2: 60
			},
			{
				id: 'C',
				title: 'Resource C',
				type1: 12,
				type2: 50
			}
		]
	});

In the above example, the resources would appear as `Resource C`, `Resource B`, `Resource A`.

If no `resourceOrder` is given (the default), resources will appear in the order they were specified.
