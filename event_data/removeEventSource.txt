removeEventSource
=================

Dynamically removes an event source.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.fullCalendar( 'removeEventSource', *source* )
</div>

Events from the source will be immediately removed from the calendar.

The `source` parameter is rather flexible.
You can provide an event source's id/Array/URL/Function
**or** you can specify the full [Event Source Object]().

To remove multiple event sources at once, resulting in a single re-render,
use [removeEventSources]().
