Event Object
============

A standard object that FullCalendar uses to store information about a calendar event.

An Event Object has a number of properties. When passing new Event Objects to 
`events` and `eventSources`, only the `title` and `start` properties are required.
Here is the full list of properties:

**id**: String/Integer (optional)
:	Uniquely identifies the given event. Different instances of repeating events should all have the same `id`.
	
**title**: String
:	The text on an event's element

**allDay**: `true` or `false` (optional)
:	Whether an event occurs at a specific time-of-day. This property affects whether an event's time is shown.
	Also, in the agenda views, determines if it is displayed in the "all-day" section.
	
	**Don't include quotes** around your `true`/`false`. This value is not a string!
	
	When specifying Event Objects for `events` or `eventSources`,
	omitting this property will make it inherit from
	[allDayDefault](), which is normally `false`.
	
**start**: Date
:	A JavaScript Date object indicating the date/time an event begins.

	When specifying Event Objects for `events` or `eventSources`,
	you may specify a string in IETF format (ex: "Wed, 18 Oct 2009 13:00:00 EST"),
	a string in ISO8601 format (ex: "2009-11-05T13:15:30Z") or a UNIX timestamp.
	
**end**: Date (optional)
:	A Javascript Date object indicating the date/time an event ends.
	As with `start`, you may specify it in IETF, ISO8601, or UNIX timestamp format.
	
	**If an event is all-day**...

	the end date is inclusive. This means an event with `start` Nov 10 and
	`end` Nov 12 will span 3 days on the calendar.

	**If an event is NOT all-day**...

	the end date is exclusive. This is only a gotcha when your `end` has time 00:00.
	It means your event ends on midnight, and it will not span through the next day.
	
**url**: String (optional)
:	A URL that will be visited when this event is clicked by the user.
	For more information on controlling this behavior, see the [eventClick](../mouse/eventClick) callback.
	
**className**: String/Array (optional)
:	A CSS class (or array of classes) that will be attached to this event's element.

**editable**: `true` or `false` (optional)
:	Overrides the master [editable](../event_ui/editable) option for this single event.

**source**: Array/String/Function (automatically populated)
:	A reference to the event source (as specified in `events` or `eventSources`)
	that this event came from.
	
	Do not worry about populating this value, FullCalendar will do this automatically.
	
	
In addition to the fields above, you may also include your own non-standard fields
in each Event Object. FullCalendar will not modify or delete these fields.
For example, developers often include a `description` field for use in callbacks such
as [eventRender](../event_rendering/eventRender).

<div class='version-info' markdown='1'>
Prior to version 1.3, the *end* date was always exclusive, even when *allDay* was set to *true*.

Prior to version 1.3, the *allDay* property did not exist. *showTime* was used instead.
It was set to *true* to show times and *false* to hide them.

The *className* and *source* properties did not exist prior to version 1.2.
