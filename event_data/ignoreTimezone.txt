ignoreTimezone *1.4.8*
======================

When parsing ISO8601 dates, whether UTC offsets should be ignored
while processing event source data.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `true`
</div>

The default is `true`, which means the UTC offset for all ISO8601 dates will be ignored.
For example, the date `"2008-11-05T08:15:30-05:00"` will be processed as
November 5th, 2008 at 8:15am *in the local offset of the browser*.

If you are using ISO8601 dates with UTC offsets, chances are you want them
processed. You must set this option to `false`. In the future, the default
for this option will probably be changed to `false`.
