events (as a json feed)
=======================

A URL of a JSON feed that the calendar will fetch [Event Objects](Event_Object) from.

FullCalendar will visit the URL whenever it needs new event data.
This happens when the user clicks prev/next or changes views.
FullCalendar will determine the date-range it needs events for and will
pass that information along in GET parameters.

The GET parameter names will be determined by the [startParam]() and [endParam]() options.
(`"start"` and `"end"` by default).

The value of the parameters will always be UNIX timestamps (seconds since 1970).

Consider the following script:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: "/myfeed.php"
	});
	
Here is a URL that FullCalendar might visit:
	
`/myfeed.php?start=1262332800&end=1265011200&_=1263178646`

The `_` parameter is automatically inserted to prevent the browser from
caching the result (see [cacheParam]()).

If you need to access a feed that is in a different domain, you can use JSONP
with a `?` in your URL (see the JSONP discussion in [$.ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/)).
