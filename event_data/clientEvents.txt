clientEvents *1.3*
==================

Retrieves events that FullCalendar has in memory.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.fullCalendar( 'clientEvents' [, *idOrFilter* ] )
</div>

This method will return an array of [Event Objects](Event_Object) that FullCalendar has stored
in client-side memory.

If `idOrFilter` is omitted, *all* events will be returned.

If `idOrFilter` is an ID, all events with the same ID will be returned.

`idOrFilter` may also be a filter function that accepts one [Event Object]()
argument and returns `true` if it should be included in the result set.

<div class='version-info' markdown='1'>
In versions 1.2 and 1.2.1, this option was known as *getEventsByID*
</div>
