eventResize *1.3*
=================

Triggered when resizing stops and the event has changed in duration.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *event*, *dayDelta*, *minuteDelta*, *revertFunc*, *jsEvent*, *ui*, *view* ) { }
</div>

`event` is an [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) that hold the event's information (date, title, etc).

`dayDelta` holds the number of days the event's end date was moved forward (a positive number) or backwards (a negative number).

`minuteDelta` holds the number of minutes the event's end time was moved forward (a positive number) or backwards (a negative number).
Only useful for the agenda views. In other views, `0` is passed in.

`dayDelta` and `minuteDelta` are elegant for dealing with multi-day and repeating events.
If updating a remote database, just add these values to the *end* of all events with the given `event.id`.

`revertFunc` is a function that, if called, reverts the event's end date to the value before the drag.
This is useful if an ajax call should fail.

`jsEvent` holds the native javascript event with low-level information such as
mouse coordinates.

`ui` holds the [jQuery UI object](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/).

`view` holds the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

Here is an example demonstrating most of these arguments:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: [
			// events here
		],
		editable: true,
		eventResize: function(event,dayDelta,minuteDelta,revertFunc) {
			
			alert(
				"The end date of " + event.title +
				"has been moved " +
				(dayDelta < 0 ? "back" : "forward") +
				dayDelta + " days and " +
				(minuteDelta < 0 ? "back : "forward") +
				minuteDelta + " minutes."
			);
			
			if (!confirm("is this okay?")) {
				revertFunc();
			}
			
		}
	});
