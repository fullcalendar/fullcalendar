eventDrop
=========

Triggered when dragging stops and the event has moved to a *different* day/time.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *event*, *delta*, *revertFunc*, *jsEvent*, *ui*, *view* ) { }
</div>

`event` is an [Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) that hold the event's information (date, title, etc).
Call `hasTime` on the event's `start`/`end` to see if it has been dropped in a timed or all-day area
([more info](../utilities/Moment#ambiguously-timed)).

`delta` is a [Duration Object](../utilities/Duration) that represents the amount of time the event
was moved by. *Available in version 2.0.1 and later.*

`revertFunc` is a function that, if called, reverts the event's start/end date to the values before the drag.
This is useful if an ajax call should fail.

`jsEvent` holds the native JavaScript event with low-level information such as
mouse coordinates.

`ui` holds an empty object. Before version 2.1, the [jQuery UI object](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/).

`view` holds the current [View Object](../views/View_Object).

eventDrop *does not* get called when an external event lands on the calendar.
[eventReceive](../dropping/eventReceive) is called instead.

Here is an example demonstrating most of these arguments:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: [
			// events here
		],
		editable: true,
		eventDrop: function(event, delta, revertFunc) {

			alert(event.title + " was dropped on " + event.start.format());
			
			if (!confirm("Are you sure about this change?")) {
				revertFunc();
			}
			
		}
	});
