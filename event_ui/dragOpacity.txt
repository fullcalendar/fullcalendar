=================

The opacity of an event when it is being dragged.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>

		agenda: .5,

		// for all other views
		'': 1.0
	}
</div>

Float values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

(which is what the default does).

Prior to version 1.3, this option was known as *eventDragOpacity*
