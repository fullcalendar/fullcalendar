eventOverlap *2.2*
==================

Determines if events on the calendar, when dragged and resized, are allowed to overlap each other.

<div markdown="1" class="spec">
boolean / function. *default*: `true`
</div>

If `false`, no events are allowed to overlap. If `true`, all events are allowed to overlap
(the default).

If given a function, the function will be called every time there is a pair of intersecting events,
whether upon a user drag or resize. The function must return `true` if the overlap should be allowed
and `false` otherwise. The below example allows overlapping only if both events are all-day:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: [ /* event data here */ ]
		eventOverlap: function(stillEvent, movingEvent) {
			return stillEvent.allDay && movingEvent.allDay;
		}
	});

`movingEvent` is the event that is being dragged or resized. Its `start` and `end` dates will remain at their
original values when the callback function is called. `stillEvent` is the event underneath the moving event.

If a timed event occurs on the same day as an all-day event, this will qualify as an intersection.
This might seem confusing in the agenda [views](../views/Available_Views) because the events don't visually intersect
because the all-day slot is separate from the timed slots. But it's still considered an overlap.

The `eventOverlap` setting does not differentiate between
[background events](../event_rendering/Background_Events) or normal events.
It treats both types of events the same way.

If you need more granular control for which events are allowed to overlap, you can do this with each
[Event Source]'s `overlap` property or with each [Event Object]'s `overlap` property.
