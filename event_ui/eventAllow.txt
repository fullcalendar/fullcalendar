eventAllow *3.0*
================

Exact programmatic control over where an event can be dropped.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function(dropInfo, draggedEvent)
</div>

After it has been determined that the [eventOverlap]() and [eventConstraint]()
settings will allow the user to drop an event at a given position on the calendar,
the `eventAllow` callback will be called. If specified, it must return either `true` or `false`
as to whether the calendar will allow the given event (`draggedEvent`) to be dropped
at the given location (`dropInfo`).

	eventAllow: function(dropLocation, draggedEvent) {
		if (draggedEvent.id === '999') {
			return dropLocation.isAfter('2016-01-01'); // a boolean
		}
		else {
			return true;
		}
	}

The `dropLocation` object will have the following properties:

- `start` (a [Moment](../utilities/Moment/))
- `end` exclusive end date/time (a [Moment](../utilities/Moment/))
- `resourceId` if you are using a [Resource View](../scheduler/)
