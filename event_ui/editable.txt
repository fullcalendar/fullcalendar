editable *1.3*
==============

Determines whether the events on the calendar can be modified.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `false`
</div>

This determines if the events can be *dragged* and *resized*.
Enables/disables both at the same time. If you don't want both,
use `editable` in conjunction with [disableDragging]() and [disableResizing]().

This option can be overridden on a per-event basis with the
[Event Object](../event_data/Event_Object) `editable` property.

<div class='version-info' markdown='1'>
Prior to version 1.3, the *draggable* option was used instead.
</div>
