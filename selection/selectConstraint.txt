selectConstraint *2.2*
======================

Limits user selection to certain windows of time.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
an event ID, `"businessHours"`, object
</div>

This value behaves identically to the way [eventConstraint](../event_ui/eventConstraint)
limits where events can go. It accepts the same values.

Only applicable when the [selectable](selectable) option is activated.
