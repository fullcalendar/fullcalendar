Usage
=====

The following code initializes a FullCalendar within an element::

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		
		// put your options here
		
	})
	

Basic Options
=============

**year, month, date**: Integers
	The initial year/month/date when the calendar loads.
	``month`` is 0-based, meaning January=0, February=1, etc.
	If ommitted, the calendar starts on the current date.

**header**: Object/``false``, *Default*: ``{ left:'title', center:'', right:'prev,next' }``
	Defines the buttons/text at the top of the calendar.
	``false`` will display no header.
	An object can be supplied with properties ``left``, ``center``, and ``right``.
	These properties contain strings with comma separated values,
	containing any of the following:
	
		``title``
			text containing the current date or date-range
		
		``prev``
			button for moving the calendar back one month/week/day
		
		``next``
			button for moving the calendar forward one month/week/day
			
		*a blank space*
			visual gap between buttons/text
		
		*a view name*
			button that will switch the calendar to any of the
			:ref:`available-views`
	
	Specifying an empty string for a property will cause it display no text/buttons.
	
	To change the text within a button, see the :ref:`buttonText<locale>` option.
	
**defaultView**: String, *Default*: ``'month'``
	The initial view when the calendar loads. Any of the :ref:`available-views`.

**aspectRatio**: Float, *Default*: ``1.35``
	A calendar is a block-level element that fills its entire avaiable width.
	The calendar's height, however, is determined by this ratio of width-to-height.
	(Hint: larger numbers make smaller heights).

**weekMode**: String, *Default*: ``'fixed'``
	Determines the number of weeks displayed in a month view.
	Also determines each week's height. Available options:
	
		``'fixed'``
			The calendar will always be 6 weeks tall.
			The ``aspectRatio`` will always be maintained.
		
		``'liquid'``
			The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
			The height of the weeks will stretch to fill the available height,
			as determined by ``aspectRatio``.
		
		``'variable'``
			The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
			The ``aspectRatio`` will NOT be maintained however. Each week will have
			a constant height, meaning the calendar's height will change month-to-month.
	
	
Event Editing
=============

**editable**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Determines whether the events on the calendar can be modified, i.e,
	if the events will be *draggable* and *resizable*.
	This can be overridden on a per-event basis with a :ref:`CalEvent's <CalEvent>`
	``editable`` property.
	
	For dragging, the `jQuery UI draggable <http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/>`_ library is required.
	
	For resizing, the `jQuery UI resizable <http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/>`_ library is required.
	
**disableDragging**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Disables all event dragging, even when events are editable.

**disableResizing**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Disables all event resizing, even when events are editable.
	
**dragOpacity**: Float, *Default*: ``1.0``
	The opacity of an event when it is being dragged.

**dragRevertDuration**: Float, *Default*: ``500``
	The time in milliseconds it takes for an event to revert to its
	original position after an unsuccessful drag.
	
	
Time & Date Formatting
======================

**titleFormat**: String/Object
	Determines the text that will be displayed in the header's title
	using :ref:`formatDates' <formatDates>`' format string. A string will set the title format
	for *all* views. An object hash will set the format on a per-view basis.
	Here is the default, showing example outputs for each view::
	
		{
			month: 'MMMM yyyy',                            // September 2009
			week: "MMM d[ yyyy]{ '&#8212;'[ MMM] d yyyy}", // Sep 7 - 13 2009
			day: 'dddd, MMM d, yyyy'                       // Tuesday, Sep 8, 2009
		}

**columnFormat**: String/Object
	Determines the text that will be displayed on a view's column headings
	using :ref:`formatDates' <formatDates>` format string. A string will set the column header format
	for *all* views. An object hash will set the format on a per-view basis.
	Here is the default, showing example outputs for each view::
	
		{
			month: 'ddd',    // Mon
			week: 'ddd M/d', // Mon 9/7
			day: 'dddd M/d'  // Monday 9/7
		}

**timeFormat**: String, *Default*: ``'h(:mm)t'``
	Determines the time-text that will be displayed on an event
	using :ref:`formatDates' <formatDates>` format string. The default format outputs text
	such as '9a' or '5:30p'.
	
	Time-text will only be displayed for :ref:`CalEvent` that have
	``allDay`` equal to ``false``.
