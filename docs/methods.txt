Methods
=======

The following are methods that can be called on a FullCalendar-initialized
jQuery object:

**prev** - .fullCalendar('prev')
	Moves the calendar one step back (either by a month, week, or day).

**next** - .fullCalendar('next')
	Moves the calendar one step forward (either by a month, week, or day).
	
**today** - .fullCalendar('today')
	Moves the calendar to the current date.
	
**gotoDate** - .fullCalendar('gotoDate', *year, [month, [date]]*)
	Moves the calendar to an arbitrary year/month/date.
	
	``month`` is 0-based, meaning January=0, February=1, etc.
	
	This method can also be called with a single argument, a Date object.
	
**incrementDate** - .fullCalendar('incrementDate', *years, [months, [days]]*)
	Moves the calendar forward/backward an arbitrary amount of time.
	
**changeView** - .fullCalendar('changeView', *viewName*)
	Immediately switches to a different view. ``viewName`` must be one of the
	:ref:`available-views`.
	
**getView** - .fullCalendar('getView')
	Returns the :ref:`View Object <view-object>` for the current view.
	This is useful if you want to get information about the calendar's title
	or start/end dates.
	
**getDate** - .fullCalendar('getDate')
	Returns a Date object for the current date of the calendar. For month view,
	it will always be sometime between the first and last day of the month. For week view,
	it will always be sometime between the first and last day of the week.
	
**updateEvent** - .fullCalendar('updateEvent', *calEvent*)
	Reports changes to a :ref:`CalEvent's <CalEvent>` standard properties.
	This will cause the event to be rerendered on the calendar.
	If there are repeating events on the calendar with the
	same ID, these events will be changed as well.
	
	``calEvent`` must be a :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>` retrieved from a
	:ref:`Triggered Action<triggered-actions>` or from the ``clientEvents`` method.
	
**renderEvent** - .fullCalendar('renderEvent', *calEvent, [stick]*)
	Renders a new event on the calendar. ``calEvent`` must have
	at least a ``title`` and a ``start``.
	
	By default, the event will disappear once the calendar refetches its event
	sources (example: when prev/next is clicked). However, specifying ``stick`` as ``true``
	will cause the event to be permanently fixed to the calendar.
	
**removeEvents** - .fullCalendar('removeEvents', *[idOrFilter]*)
	If the second argument is omitted, all events are removed.
	If the second argument is an ID, all events with
	the same ID will be removed.
	
	The second argument may also be a filter function that accepts
	one :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>` argument and returns ``true`` if it
	should be removed.
	
**clientEvents** - .fullCalendar('clientEvents', *[idOrFilter]*)
	This method will return an array of :ref:`CalEvents <CalEvent>` that
	FullCalendar has stored on the client-side (browser).
	
	If the second argument is omitted, all events will be returned.
	If the second argument is an ID, all events with the
	same ID will be returned.
	
	The second argument may also be a filter function that accepts
	one :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>` argument and returns ``true`` if it should
	be included in the result set.

**addEventSource** - .fullCalendar('addEventSource', *source*)
	Adds an :ref:`Event Source <event-sources>`. ``source`` may be an array/string/function just as in
	the ``events`` option. Events will be immediately fetched from this source
	and placed on the calendar.

**removeEventSource** - .fullCalendar('removeEventSource', *source*)
	Removes an :ref:`Event Source <event-sources>`. ``source`` must be a reference to the
	original array/string/function. Events from the source will immediately be
	removed from the calendar.

**rerenderEvents** - .fullCalendar(``'rerenderEvents'``)
	Rerenders all events on the screen.

**refetchEvents** - .fullCalendar(``'refetchEvents'``)
	Refetches events from all sources and rerenders them on the screen.
	
**render** - .fullCalendar(``'render'``)
	Immediately renders the calendar if is is not already visible.
	If the calendar *is* already visible, readjusts its size.
	
	This method is useful in the scenario where a tab setup might hide/show
	a calendar. Call this method whenever the calendar's tab is shown.

Dynamically Getting/Setting Properties
--------------------------------------

You may dynamically *retrieve* any of a FullCalendar's options using the following form::
	
	$('#calendar').fullCalendar('option', 'optionName'); // returns the value
	
You may dynamically *set* some of FullCalendar's options using the following form::

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar('option', 'optionName', 'optionValue');
	
**HOWEVER**, setting only works for the three following options: **apsectRatio**, **contentHeight**, and **height**.

The next version of FullCalendar will have more advancements in this area.
