
Methods
=======

The following are methods that can be called on a FullCalendar-initialized
jQuery object:

**prev** - .fullCalendar('prev')
	Moves the calendar one step back (either by a month, week, or day).

**next** - .fullCalendar('next')
	Moves the calendar one step forward (either by a month, week, or day).
	
**today** - .fullCalendar('today')
	Moves the calendar to the current date.
	
**gotoDate** - .fullCalendar('gotoDate', *year, [month, [date]]*)
	Moves the calendar to an arbitrary year/month/date.
	
	``month`` is 0-based, meaning January=0, February=1, etc.
	
**moveDate** - .fullCalendar('moveDate', *years, [months, [days]]*)
	Moves the calendar forward/backward an arbitrary amount of time.
	
**updateEvent** - .fullCalendar('updateEvent', *calEvent*)
	Reports changes about a modified :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>`. This will cause the event
	to be rerendered on the calendar.
	If there are repeating events on the calendar with the
	same ID, these events will be changed as well.
	
	``calEvent`` must be a :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>` retrieved from a
	:ref:`Triggered Action<triggered-actions>` or from the ``clientEvents`` method.
	
**renderEvent** - .fullCalendar('renderEvent', *calEvent, [stick]*)
	Renders a new event on the calendar. ``calEvent`` must have
	at least a ``title`` and a ``start``.
	
	By default, the event will disappear once the calendar refetches its event
	sources (example: when prev/next is clicked). However, specifying ``stick`` as ``true``
	will cause the event to be permanently fixed to the calendar.
	
**removeEvents** - .fullCalendar('removeEvents', *[idOrFilter]*)
	If the second argument is omitted, all events are removed.
	If the second argument is a :ref:`CalEvent's <CalEvent>` ID, all events with
	the same ID will be removed.
	
	The second argument may also be a filter function that accepts
	one :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>` argument and returns ``true`` or ``false`` about
	whether it should be removed.
	
**clientEvents** - .fullCalendar('clientEvents', *[idOrFilter]*)
	This method will return :ref:`CalEvents <CalEvent>` that FullCalendar has stored on
	the client-side (browser).
	
	If the second argument is omitted, all events will be returned.
	If the second argument is a :ref:`CalEvent's <CalEvent>` ID, all events with the
	same ID will be returned.
	
	The second argument may also be a filter function that accepts
	one :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvent>` argument and returns ``true`` or ``false`` about
	whether it should be included in the result set.

**addEventSource** - .fullCalendar('addEventSource', *source*)
	Adds an :ref:`Event Source <event-sources>`. ``source`` may be an array/string/function just as in
	the ``events`` option. Events will be immediately fetched from this source
	and placed on the calendar.

**removeEventSource** - .fullCalendar('removeEventSource', *source*)
	Removes an :ref:`Event Source <event-sources>`. ``source`` must be a reference to the
	original array/string/function. Events from the source will immediately be
	removed from the calendar.

**rerenderEvents** - .fullCalendar(``'rerenderEvents'``)
	Rerenders all events on the screen.

**refetchEvents** - .fullCalendar(``'refetchEvents'``)
	Refetches events from all event sources and rerenders them on the screen.
