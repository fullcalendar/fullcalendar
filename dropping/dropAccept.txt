dropAccept *1.4.7*
==================

Provides a way to filter which elements can be dropped onto the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
String/Function, *default*: `"*"`
</div>

By default, after setting a calendar' [droppable]() option to `true`, the calendar
will accept any draggables that are dropped onto the calendar. The `dropAccept` option
allows the calendar be more selective about which elements can/can't be dropped.

The value of `dropAccept` can be a string [jQuery selector](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).
It can also be a function that accepts the draggable item as a single argument, and returns `true`
if the element can be dropped onto the calendar.

In the following example, the first draggable (with id `"draggable1"`) can be dropped on the calendar,
while the second draggable (with id `"draggable2"`) cannot:

	...
	<div id='calendar'></div>
	
	<div id='draggable1' class='cool-event'></div>
	<div id='draggable2'></div>
	...

and here is the JavaScript:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		droppable: true,
		dropAccept: '.cool-event',
		drop: function() {
			alert('dropped!');
		}
	});
	
	$('#draggable1').draggable();
	$('#draggable2').draggable();
