droppable *1.4.7*
=================

Determines if jQuery UI draggables can be dropped onto the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `false`
</div>

This option operates with jQuery UI draggables. You must [download](http://jqueryui.com/download)
the appropriate jQuery UI files and initialize a [draggable](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/) element.
Additionally, you must set the calendar's `droppable` option to `true`.

Here is how you might initialize an element that can be dragged onto a calendar:

	$('#my-draggable').draggable({
		revert: true,      // immediately snap back to original position
		revertDuration: 0  //
	});

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		droppable: true,
		drop: function(date, allDay) {
			alert("Dropped on " + date + " with allDay=" + allDay);
		}
	});
	
	
How can I use this to add events???
-----------------------------------

Good question. It is a common need to have an "external list of events" that can be
dragged onto the calendar.

While the `droppable` option deals with generic jQuery UI draggables and is not specifically
tailored to adding events, it is possible to achieve this with a few lines of code.
Follow the **external-dragging.html** example in FullCalendar's download. You can also
view the [example online](../../../../js/fullcalendar-1-latest/demos/external-dragging.html).

In short, you must call [renderEvent](../event_rendering/renderEvent) yourself
in the [drop]() callback.

Hopefully, this task will become more convenient with future API changes.
