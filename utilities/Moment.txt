Moment
======

Moment objects are used throughout the API. A Moment object represents a point in time,
like the native [Date Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date),
but is far superior.
MomentJS is a third-party library that must be included on the same page as FullCalendar.

> **[Visit the MomentJS website](http://momentjs.com/)**

For more information on how to include MomentJS on your page, see [Basic Usage](../usage).

In the API, most options that accept a Moment will also conveniently accept anything
that the `moment()` constructor accepts, including:

- date strings (ISO8601 is **highly** recommended)
- unix offsets (milliseconds since the Unix Epoch)
- native Date objects


<h2 id='creating'>Creating Moments from scratch</h2>

Most of the time you won't have to worry about instantiating your own Moments.
For example, when specify [event array](../event_data/events_array/) data, you can just write
ISO8601 strings and let FullCalendar handle the parsing.

However, creating Moments from scratch is sometimes necessary.
Since Moment is a dependency of FullCalendar, the global `moment` constructor will likely
be available to you. You should be able to create new Moments from scratch like this:

	var m = moment();

To create a moment with FullCalendar's [extended formatting](date_formatting_string)
and "ambiguous" functionality (see below),
use FullCalendar's version of the `moment`, `moment.utc`, and `moment.parseZone` constructors:

	var noTime = $.fullCalendar.moment('2014-05-01');
	var local = $.fullCalendar.moment('2014-05-01T12:00:00');
	var utc = $.fullCalendar.moment.utc('2014-05-01T12:00:00');
	var noTZ = $.fullCalendar.moment.parseZone('2014-05-01T12:00:00');

To create a moment with extended functionality that is already scoped within a given
calendar's [timezone](../timezone/timezone) and [locale](../text/locale) settings,
use the `Calendar` object's version of the `moment` constructor:

	var calendar = $('#calendar').fullCalendar('getCalendar');
	var m = calendar.moment();


<h2 id='ambiguously-timed'>Ambiguously-timed Moments</h2>

For FullCalendar, the Moment object has been extended to represent a
moment without a time, or an "ambigously-timed moment". Under the hood, these moments
are represented in [UTC-mode] with a time of `00:00:00`.

To create one, you can use FullCalendar's version of the `moment`, `moment.utc`, or `moment.parseZone`
constructor in tandem with an ISO8601 string without a time part:

	var m = $.fullCalendar.moment('2014-01-22');
	m.hasTime();
	=> false

As you can see, you can query if a moment is ambiguously-timed by using the `hasTime` method.
This method is only available on moments created through one of FullCalendar's moment constructors.

You can also convert a timed moment to ambiguous by using the `stripTime` method.
This method is only available on moments created through one of FullCalendar's moment constructors.

	var m = $.fullCalendar.moment('2014-01-22T05:00:00');
	m.stripTime();
	m.hasTime();
	=> false

The `format` and `toISOString` methods have been modified so that ambiguously-timed moments
do to not return a time part in the string:

	m.format();
	=> "2013-01-22"


<h2 id='ambiguously-zoned'>Ambiguously-zoned Moments</h2>

The moment object has also been extended to represent a date with no specified timezone.
Under the hood, these moments are represented in [UTC-mode].

To create one, you can use FullCalendar's version of the `moment.parseZone` constructor in tandem
with an ISO8601 string without a timezone offset part:

	var m = $.fullCalendar.moment.parseZone('2014-01-22T06:00:00');
	m.hasZone();
	=> false

As you can see, you can query if a moment is ambiguously-zoned by using the `hasZone` method.
This method is only available on moments created through one of FullCalendar's moment constructors.

You can also convert unambiguous to ambiguous by using the `stripZone` method.
This method is only available on moments created through one of FullCalendar's moment constructors.

	var m = $.fullCalendar.moment('2014-01-22T05:00:00-07:00');
	m.stripZone();
	m.hasZone();
	=> false

The `format` and `toISOString` methods have been modified so that ambiguously-zoned moments
do not return a timezone offset part in the string:

	m.format();
	=> "2014-01-22T05:00:00"


Other extensions
----------------

Extended moments will have the `time` utility available to them, which is a getter/setter for the
hours/minutes/seconds/milliseconds part of the moment. It accepts/returns a [Duration](Duration)-ish
object representing the time:

	var m = moment();
	m.time('05:30:00');
	m.time(); // returns Duration with 05:30:00
