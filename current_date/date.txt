date *1.3*
==========

The initial date-of-the-month when the calendar loads.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Integer

This option only matters for the week & day views. Month view does not need this option,
because month view always displays the entire month from start to finish.

If `date` is unspecified, and `year`/`month` are set to the current year/month, then the
calendar will start on the current date. If `date` is unspecified, and `year`/`month` are *not*
set to the current year/month, then the calendar will start on the first of the month.
